          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>What is Ajo?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              Ajo (also called Esusu or Susu) is a traditional West African rotating savings system. 
              A group of people contribute a fixed amount regularly, and one member receives the full 
              pot each cycle until everyone has received their payout. It's a community-based way to 
              save money and access lump sums without traditional banking.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>How is Ajosave different from traditional Ajo?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              Traditional Ajo relies entirely on trust — there's no guarantee members will pay or that 
              the organizer won't disappear with the money. Ajosave uses blockchain smart contracts on 
              Stellar to make the process trustless and automatic. Contributions are locked in the contract, 
              payouts happen automatically, and no one can cheat the system.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>Why should I use Ajosave instead of a bank savings account?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              Ajosave offers several advantages: no minimum balance requirements, no monthly fees, 
              automatic discipline through group commitment, and access to lump sums earlier in the cycle. 
              Plus, your funds are held in USDC stablecoin, protecting you from currency devaluation.

        <section className={styles.section}>
          <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>How Payouts Work</h2>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>How is the payout order determined?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              When you join a circle, you're assigned a position number. The payout order is randomized 
              when the circle starts (once all members have joined). Position 1 receives the first payout, 
              position 2 receives the second, and so on. You can see your position on the circle details page.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>When do I receive my payout?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              Payouts happen automatically at the end of each cycle based on the circle's frequency 
              (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). You'll receive an SMS notification 24 hours before your 
              payout is processed. The funds are sent directly to your Stellar wallet.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>What happens if someone misses a contribution?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              If a member misses a contribution, they're marked as "defaulted" and cannot receive future 
              payouts. The circle continues with remaining active members. Defaulted members are still 
              responsible for their missed contributions and may face reputation score penalties.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>Can I receive my payout early?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              No, the payout order is fixed when the circle starts and cannot be changed. This ensures 
              fairness for all members. However, you can join multiple circles with different start dates 
              to receive payouts at different times.

        <section className={styles.section}>
          <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>About USDC & Stellar</h2>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>What is USDC?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin — a cryptocurrency that's always worth $1 USD. It's backed 
              by real US dollars held in reserve, so it doesn't fluctuate in value like Bitcoin or other 
              cryptocurrencies. This makes it perfect for savings circles where you need predictable amounts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>What is Stellar?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              Stellar is a blockchain network designed for fast, low-cost payments. Transactions cost 
              fractions of a cent and settle in 3-5 seconds. Ajosave uses Stellar because it's perfect 
              for financial applications — reliable, affordable, and built for moving money globally.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>Do I need to understand blockchain to use Ajosave?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              No! We handle all the blockchain complexity behind the scenes. You just need a phone number 
              to sign up and a Stellar wallet to receive payouts. Think of it like using a banking app — 
              you don't need to understand how banks work internally.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>Why do I contribute in Naira but receive USDC?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              You pay in Naira (₦) via Paystack for convenience, and we automatically convert it to USDC 
              at the current exchange rate. This protects your savings from Naira devaluation during the 
              circle duration. When you receive your payout in USDC, you can convert it back to Naira or 
              keep it as dollars.

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>Is my money safe?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              Yes. Your contributions are held in a Soroban smart contract on the Stellar blockchain — 
              not in a bank account controlled by Ajosave or any person. The contract code is public and 
              auditable. Once funds are in the contract, they can only be released according to the 
              programmed rules (automatic payouts to members in order).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>Can Ajosave steal my money?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              No. Ajosave doesn't have access to funds once they're in the smart contract. We can't 
              withdraw, freeze, or redirect your money. The contract is immutable — even we can't change 
              how it works after deployment.

          <div className={styles.faqItem}>
            <h3 className={styles.question}>What is a reputation score?</h3>
            <p className={styles.answer}>
              Your reputation score (0-100) is built from your contribution history across all circles. 
              On-time payments increase your score, while missed contributions decrease it. A higher score 
              makes you more trustworthy to other members and may unlock benefits like priority positions 
              in future circles.

              Yes! Click "Create Circle" from the dashboard. You'll set the contribution amount, number 
              of members, and cycle frequency. You can make it public (anyone can join) or private 
              (you approve each member). As the creator, you're also a member and will receive a payout 
              in the rotation.
